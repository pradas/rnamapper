Mapping RNA Secondary Structure into an Alignment
=================================================

It's usual to encode secondary or tertiary structures for sequences as strings of specific sets of symbols. In this case, we have a string containing a set of nested parentheses, __SQstr__, which define sequence complementarity between the nucleotide sequences conforming the hairpins of an RNA molecule, namely __SQref__. We were provided with a set of similar RNA molecules that were aligned against our reference sequence. However, most RNA structure visalization tools cannot map the contacts string over different sequences. Thus, we need a Perl script that projects the contacts string for __SQref__ on every sequence aligned to it. You must take into account that nucleotide substitutions can affect the pairings described by the set of parentheses. Furthermore, gaps in the alignment can delete sequence that is at the same position of an opening or closing paranthesis. So that, the script has to produce a specific contacts string for each sequence in the alignment but it has to ensure that all the parentheses are properly balanced. Those mismatched parenthesis should be replaced by a dot (".") in order to get a contacts string suitable for most visualization tools. The figure on the right shows the RNA secondary structure for __SQref__, it was generated by VARNA 2D viewer demo web server. You can include on the report a table with the adjusted 2D figure for each sequence.
